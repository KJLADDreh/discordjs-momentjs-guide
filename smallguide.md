# NPM Installing

Let's begin with installing everything, and this is quite simple run these two commands if you haven't already in the past.

```npm install discord.js```
then 
```npm install moment```

# Editing the code.

Now I only know how to work this in Embeds so if your using plain text this won't work unless your an advanced coder but anyway let's continue..

**Code below:**

```javascript
.addField("Text", `${moment.utc(code).format("")}`)
```

That's the basic code, to format the date/time go to this website for examples and go wander with Momentjs.

Yes I learned this the hard way (taking three hours) but in the end I wanted to change this into a teaching experience.
If you need help or anything setup a issue and I or someone else will help you.



Happy coding!
